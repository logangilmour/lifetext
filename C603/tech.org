* K-Nearest Neigbors Algorithm
** Overview of what it is
*** Lazy classification method
*** Looks to closest examples in training set
**** Distance in N-dimensional space, where N is the number of measures
**** Majority vote within K nearest

** Laziness

** Measures
**** For discrete variables, overlap can be calculated

**** Need good measures
***** Car classification - speed vs cost

** Choosing K


** Running time
**** Worst case can be O(N) where N is size of training set.
**** In a naive implementation, this will always be the runtime.
**** Skewed training data can be problematic, because lots of one thing makes it winning the majority vote more likely.

** Uses
