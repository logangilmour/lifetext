* Things to figure out
** Can I sort out which libraries are 'foundational' and which are 'aggregates'? I.e., which projects don't have many imports outside of the standard library?
** Can I cluster libraries somehow? Do patterns of imports have anything to do with type of project? This would capture foundational imports, in that they would match a pattern that involved java standard-lib imports probably.
** Given a project, if I get projects that have a similiar signature (i.e. set of imports) will that mean anything?
** We have the data for age of projects. Maybe we can determine a metric that takes that into account.

** Theories: Age will correlate with popularity. More popular repositories will have been around longer, and will
