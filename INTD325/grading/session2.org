* Phobia
** Rules
*** Nothing in rules about classes
*** Says different things about carrying on cards and in rules
*** Why do we get to place locks?
*** What does eyes/body parts mean? (fear card)
*** Maybe more explanation of moving than neccessary
*** what happens to the monster card after drawn?
*** How do we stack damage
*** What happens if my health goes to 11?
*** Stairs not obvious
*** Locks - why orientation
*** No state marker for fear draw
*** Monster phase, full moon - 2 drawn?
*** Master hand? Who moves?
*** We are not losing at all.
*** Lock picks for theif?

* Gauche
** 5 player variant doesn't feel possible - arson strategy seems unbeatable.
** Everything else rad

* AssassinsZ
** Paper health meter tokens horrible and easy to lose
** Why can you move so far in the sewer?
** Combat about multiple players thing a little unclear
** Adjacent isnt' adjacent - thansk for pic
** Rock rules? Does rock mess up combat? Must a room be exposed? Does a rock reveal a room if you throw it through an unknown door?
** Hard to pick up player tokens
** Item markers would be nice - cards are big.
** Defense seems crappy, stealth great
** Kimberly with another player is pretty powerful
** Like the quick reference!
** Why coins? People grab them.
** game not hard.
** guards moving somehow would have helped.
