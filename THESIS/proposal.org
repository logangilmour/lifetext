* Background
** Crowdsourcing
*** Wikipedia
*** Rise of the Internet
** Human Computation
*** Definition
    Humans solving problems at the prompting of a computer. Problem might be solvable using AI one day, but it is cheaper/easier to use humans right now. (Quinn:2011:HCS:1978942.1979148)
*** Humans as a part of a system, black-box computation units. 
** GWAP
*** ESP
*** Foldit
*** Motivation (what is special about this class of Human Computation)
** Gamification
* Problem
** Adding points to some tasks doesn't work
** Designing good Human Computation tasks
*** Emphasize computational, systems approach.
*** Big(0) notation for understanding complexity of computer task
*** Need an intuitive understanding of complexity of a human task.
*** Important to stay within upper and lower bounds.
* Approach
** Design Patterns
** Heuristic for good human task
** Informed by Flow research
*** Existing work within Video Games
**** Note that challenge is highlighted as most important in GameFlow
*** Focus on Challenge and Feedback
** Indoor Navigation Case Study
*** Significant Research Exists
*** Good fit for Human Computation
* Significance
** Current GWAPs have varying success
** Powerful tool for understanding what makes good human computation
** Powerful tool for creating human computation systems
* Applications
** AMT
** Cheating
** Increase Thouroghput
