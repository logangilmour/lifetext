The sun's will rise, and when it does,
the world will dance. We'll sing because
a thought was perched where someone dreamed,
and woken up, the faces gleamed

in moonlight cast through love. The past
makes shadows flicker, holding fast
onto the feet who stand their ground,
and laugh, as voices come unbound.

To pass the time, we split the day
up in to parts. Our work and play,
divided by a thinking blade,
grew apart. Then meaning frayed

as strands were strained by winds that framed
a different way to live. We blamed
the night, but dusk is love and death.
Once thrown below a murmurred breath

of air we waited for a chance
to build a future, and enhance
the little bits of stuff that sticks,
As people gather laying bricks,

to stop all time. A storm of weird
and wildish growth that we have feared
has been supressed. A structure holds
the strangling trees at bay. The folds

of minds that formed in safer songs
discovered light. The rights and wrongs
were added up and found to sum
to nothing. So upon the drum

we beat a blazing heartbeat out
across the void, and hoped a shout
or two might reach some ears that hear
our strains and send a sky to steer

us to the truth. But waiting for
an answer showed us even more
than we had hoped. The strength we found
by rooting down into the ground

would bring us flight, and farther sight,
and words and pictures filled the white
of unmarked pages. Life grew small.
But also large, enfolding all.

We looked and thought and looked again
at empty spaces, wondering when
the cracks would spread and what we knew
would shatter. So the tension threw

itself across the space to find
the voices that could help unwind
a confidence that might not be
aligned with what a touch might see.

And now we're here to feel the pull
of strangish stirrings, and the full-
ness of the change in how we break
up into parts has left an ache

that flips the world. But where are we?
If no one knows, perhaps we're free
to choose ourselves, and redefine
interpretations of the sign

that calls to us. A sweeping flow
of brand-new ways the world could grow
up into stronger shapes that soar
with life that's learning more and more.

But scary things will grow up too.
When rules are stripped away, the new
might sometimes be less nice than we
would hope. But careful, we'll stay free

to see the dark come though the deep.
And murky monsters may still creep
to prey upon an unwatched thought
that bubbles up when thinking's caught

within a cage of love and light.
So don't forget the grasping night.
Though passion blooms to catch the air,
forgotten depths forever stare.

So journey on! The sun might set,
but preparation for the net
that fear has set to trap the brave
will foil the plans to plot the grave

of time. When sadness breaks the day,
the sun will shine a lifeless ray
that gives no strength. Without a store
of inner fire, the burning core

will cool and stop and turn to stone.
So know it comes! Don't go alone.
Those friendly faces trace between
the empty spaces that we've seen

must always lurk in worlds whose curve
is big enough to test your nerve.
A wiser friend can guide our smiles
to currents that will flow for miles

to deeper wilds that stream arcane.
