The sun's will rise, and when it does,
the world will dance. We'll sing because
a thought was perched where someone dreamed,
and woken up, the faces gleamed

in moonlight cast through love. The past
makes shadows flicker, holding fast
onto the feet who stand their ground,
and laugh, as voices come unbound.

To pass the time, we split the day
up in to parts. Our work and play,
divided by a thinking blade,
grew apart. Then meaning frayed

as strands were strained by winds that framed
a different way to live. We blamed
the night, but dusk is love and death.
Once thrown below a murmurred breath

of air we waited for a chance
to build a future, and enhance
the little bits of stuff that sticks,
As people gather laying bricks,

to stop all time. A storm of weird
and wildish growth that we have feared
has been supressed. A structure holds
the strangling trees at bay. The folds

of minds that formed in safer songs
discovered light. The rights and wrongs
were added up and found to sum
to nothing. So upon the drum

we beat a blazing heartbeat out
across the void, and hoped a shout
or two might reach some ears that hear
our strains and send a sky to steer

us to the truth. But waiting for
an answer showed us even more
than we had hoped. The strength we found
by rooting down into the ground

would bring us flight, and farther sight,
and words and pictures filled the white
of unmarked pages. Life grew small.
But also large, enfolding all.
