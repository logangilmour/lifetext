The sun's will rise, and when it does,
the world will dance. We'll sing because
a thought was perched where someone dreamed,
and woken up, the faces gleamed

in moonlight cast through love. The past
makes shadows flicker, holding fast
onto the feet who stand their ground,
and laugh, as voices come unbound.

To pass the time, we split the day
up in to parts. Our work and play,
divided by a thinking blade,
grew apart.
