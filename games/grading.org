* Dragon Conquest
** Notes
*** Fun
**** Action programming worked nicely!
**** Do I want to help the dragon? Since friendly fire is allowed, why don't I just keep killing the dragon?
**** Is it possible to win as the dragon? Big advantage for humans to always go first - can have guaranteed hits. 
**** Dragon was frustrated because going last meant no plans.
**** Non pre-determined rotate/warps really nice.
**** some lack of depth - most of the game was setting up to hammer on the first turn with buffs and stuff.
**** Warrior could have been more defensive? Think WOW where warrior distracts and projects.
**** If you get all moves or all attacks it's a bit of a bummer - would be nice to have had some kind of alternative.
**** What if you come back and you lose turn 1, then turn 2, then turn 3, then permadeath?
**** What if do nothing cards healed?
**** What if the dragon was just random movements?
*** Prototype
**** Symbology a bit confusing.
**** arrow looks like a plus on fire breath.
*** Rules
**** Frozen is a bit confusing on the card - easy to miss that it doesn't just describe the attack.
**** Do Nothing? Says (move) - what does this mean?
**** Can technically turn 720 degrees?
**** Can flight let you rotate?
**** Battle cry - wording confusing on buffs - each has different wording.
**** 'Intentional' in italics for leapfrogging - what?
**** Do the other players win if the dragon wins?
*** Constraints
**** 41 minutes

* Garden's Divide
** Time: 1:07
** Notes
*** Fun
**** Very hard to win combat as the aggressor - no one ever did.
**** Initial placement is almost the whole game.
*** Prototype
**** Nice prototype - liked that the paperclips matched the colours.
**** Tokens were nice and easy to handle.
**** Folding board was a little awkward - the edges curled and things would get caught underneath.
*** Rules
**** Why no summoning minion explanation?
**** We assumed you place planter and flower simultaneously to start?
**** When does combat happen? You say combat happens immediately on entering another's teritorry, but then specify that you just discard two attack cards and replace the flower in another section.
**** Where do we summon minions to?
**** What happens when 2 players share a plot where one player has a flower
**** What happens when two planters are on a third planters territory?
**** What happens if two minions are on the same space?
**** What is the other win condition?
**** How many actions to move to a claimed plot and replace?
**** Why wait until later for charm to resolve?
**** Can you summon a minion to a contested plot? What happens when a minion wins when a minion is summoned to a contested plot?
**** What does retreat three mean? Can you go in a circle sortof?

*** Constraints
**** Matched card well
**** Played in barely over an hour - good!
**** played correct number of players
* Shank'n Bribe
** Time 32 minutes
** Notes
*** Fun
**** Guards don't do very much. Ours stayed in the courtyard. Map is very connected, so getting moved matters little.
**** Why a bonus for 3?
**** We never got anywhere near the hand limit. Why is discarding an action?
**** There's not much to do in the game.
*** Prototype
**** Missing 4 from black cards.
**** Guards were too similiar.
*** Rules
**** Can you pass through rooms that others control? 
*** Constraints
**** Set collection not really met - basically got stuff then got found where it fit.
