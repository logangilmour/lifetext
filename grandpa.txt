Some of my best childhood memories are of trips out to Pidgeon lake. For many of those trips, I was to young to really understand how far away it was, or where we traveled to get there. I did, however, know that once we could see the Lake-home Tower, we were close. I was always excited to see it.

In the summer-time, it meant saskatoons, the number of which always amazed me, and sprinklers and toy golf-clubs to play with in the back yard. If it was winter, we might soon be riding GTs out on the lake or playing hockey on freshly flooded ice, after which we would warm up in the hottub, where there would be submarines to play with. If it was Christmas, we'd watch Rudolph by the fire, while playing with lego and other toys. I always looked forward to scalloped potatoes and ham, which, to this date, I can't eat together without remembering the kitchen, and the jingles from the radio that often played in there.

The time I spent out at the lake is very deeply a part of me. It was one of the earliest places I explored, and I will never forget how it felt to be there with you.
