Canyon

Gone, walkin' in the wind, 
burnin' with a face from another place
 that has followed me.
 
 Thoughts coming in too close,
 howl like a ghost, and it sounds like most
 of them cannot see
 
 How changes come to pass,
 nothing ever lasts, and the mind will cast
 out the sun to be
 
 one with a sinking stone.
 Little voices moan, cracks have always grown
 into chasms. We
 
 go Down, down, down.
 Finding a smile or a frown.
 Breath so deep,
 Life in the water will seep.
 
 Dark, light will wash away,
 just another day, consciousness will stray
 as I fall asleep.
 
 Cold, I will try to feel
 like the world is real, shadows try to steal
 my control, they creep
 
 through, slippery like a rock
 when the rain will talk, maybe it is mocking
 my strained relief.
 
Words scatter in the wind,
hook into my skin, I don't think I'm winning
this strange belief.

Down, down, down.
Head bows beneath a lead crown.
Where's the seed?
Echoes of nothing but need.

Who left a bit behind, 
here for me to find, product of a mind
that could flow through time.

Feet, used to walk a trail,
maybe they were frail, but they tell a tale
of a deep sublime.

Far, down below a song,
could I sing along, wish that it were stronger
to course through me.

Hand, up against the wall,
Maybe voices call, will my progress stall
as they turn and flee.

Down, down, down
Where did I leave that last sound?
Follow, see.
How did you learn to be free?
