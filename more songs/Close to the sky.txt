Rising

I'm getting close to the sky
Like a wisping of smoke or an unheard reply
Gods, like the flowers, grow strong
In the high thinning air where the mind coasts along.
	Clouds form a pillar of light
where they part to reveal the sun shining bright
Death has been waiting to see
If I'm going to keep breathing at such heights as these.
	And the trick's to stop caring and start with the same
The voices that share their advice might be blame-ing
themselves for denying the visions they had
where the world had changed and they stopped being sad.
	I'm getting close to the sky
There's a cleanness of air and I can't help but try
to convey to myself that I long
for the strength to imagine that nothing's gone wrong.
	And the sea far below is the end
of the world, it keeps moving - a message to send
that a heart shouldn't beat all alone
Through the time and the space that the ocean has shown
	And the rocks crumble down into rivers of sand
that arrive on the beaches where people will stand
in it holding the stars in their pockets of sight
as they bathe in a moment of glinting moonlight.
	I'm getting close to the sky
I can smell that the answer is out there - it's 'why'.
Streams from the snow burble songs
and they join on the mountain, a voice that belongs
	To the ancient and towering face
that looks down to the valley so green - it's the place
where I've been and I'll go once again.
As my wanderings close - though I couldn't say when.
	There's a rugged destruction that shapes the resolve
of the winds that howl bleeding the warmth to dissolve
in the high mountain air where the nothing will thrive
and the thoughts will grow clearer if you stay alive.
