We scrounged up bits and scraps and snips
of what was left from other ships
whose spars were smashed and cloth had rips
from bullets fired by words from lips

of men who tried to change the world
with fires that roared and guns that hurled
their souls into the stars that twirled
across the night as clouds unfurled

to catch the light the moon had cast
along with flashes of the blast
that tore apart the sky at last
to kill the future, burn the past.

Now life's adrift, unstuck in time
and we're left scrounging in the grime
for what there is that lets us climb
up high into the blue sublime.

We nailed and stitched and cut and tied
the ropes and planks and cloth we spied
while thinking of the ones who died,
the none who won, the few who tried.

For weeks we worked beneath the sun
that dried the bones that spiders spun
their webs across those years that run
together now that all are one.

And then we stopped, with work complete.
An airship built, and wind to meet,
and rain and snow and hail and sleet,
and nicer days, whose glowing heat

I basked in as my mind took flight.
But then I had an awful fright,
as fractured meanings cracked in spite
of things we'd tried to turn back right.

The weirding ways of shattered space
destroyed the ship, and left no trace
before we'd gone a single place,
or made a friend, or won a race.
