The silhouette of steel was cast
across a city where the past
has settled steaming, bright, and vast,
and multiplied as minds amassed

along streets that writhe and strain
to straighten, but it's all in vain.
Though time might fly, the falling rain
will keep on dripping through the brain

that forms in any place that thoughts
have piled up in vacant lots
and busy streets tied up in knots
and pretty little greener spots.

One such thought I had as we
were straying near a roof to see
what was inside. A twitch! Then she
was floating up, like us, now free.

Those things behind, those things before,
had let her slip away and soar
away from worry's open door,
to feel the calming winds restore

her dancing heart to steps that slowed
as I peered down and Felix crowed
"Hang on!" and strands of sunlight glowed
across the hair that flipped and flowed

and mesmerized me as I stared
in wonder as the noises flared
up from the captors who had fared
so poorly, and now stood and glared.

I should have payed attention to
the way we headed as we flew
but she was something strange and new
and tangled thoughts of what to do

made one lone tower fail to miss
our ship, which soon began to hiss
away that fleeting, floating bliss.
We spiralled down, she blew a kiss.
