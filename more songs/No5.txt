I woke to find myself thrown clear.
I turned my head and gripped the fear
that sprung to see our ship so near
the edge where she would disappear

with just a little breath of breeze.
I got up to my hands and knees,
to see some cord caught in the trees
had saved her. Then I ran to seize

some larger ropes to tie her fast
before her growing weight surpassed
the strain the cord could bear. Aghast,
I heard the creaking trees harrassed

by breaking branches as our ship
became to much. I watched her slip
a few more feet toward the lip
that kissed the void. I felt the skip

of missing beats my heart forgot.
As I drew near, I looked and thought
I saw a man aboard who fought
to drag a rope, then tie a knot,

then vault off to ground, then dash
to find a great old tree to lash
the rope's end to. And in a flash
he did just that. And then, a Crash!

The cording failed, the rope went taught
and held. I ran up to the spot
the man now stood, and there we caught
our breath 'till we could form a thought.

Then Felix came with help in tow.
While flying in I heard him crow
"Are you alright?" I told him so.
We reached the edge and peered below.

Though battered, twisted, torn and cracked
She'd held together as she'd smacked
against the cliff, so we attacked
just how to hoist her up intact.
