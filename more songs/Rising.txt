City

I'm waiting for the sunrise and the birds are waking up now.
And although it would be unwise,I still want to call you. Somehow
my decisions have been pointless, when I drink, they fade away.
Just like mists of morning solace dissapear with a new day.

The sky is burning as the sun explodes across the world,
and I just try to hold on as my mind is grabbed and hurled
out through the grand rebuilding of the consciousness of man
to walk among the people who all try to understand

what is it that we're doing. With no sleep I cannot wake.
There's purpose in pursuing and a thing out there to take.
I'll settle for a stranger though the end is still in sight.
And then I'll watch the sunrise and forget to say goodnight.

The clouds have all caught fire, and the horns begin call.
The tires on the pavement creep across the urban sprawl.
I sometimes miss the country, though the city's nice as well.
There's trees here too, the sky is blue, just less. But time will tell.

My hunger comes on stronger as food gets left aside 
and my focus growing stronger helps forget the things I tried.
The shape of every morning is a burning spear of light
that rips into the reeling though another haze, till night.

I smell the warming grasses and the flowers who decide
that today's a day to open up the colours locked inside.
People stumble waking as they hope that it's alright,
to be a person rising from the sea beneath the night.
