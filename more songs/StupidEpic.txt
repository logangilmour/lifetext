I struck myself down from the list
of men whose dreams should come to pass
and waited on that gentle twist
of road that shimmered into glass

as sunlight burned on fiery days
that tore me from my gentle sleeps
in later morning's horrid blaze.
The heat in which my sadness creeps

into my head. To tell me that
there's nothing good to do right now.
The futile little thermostat
has lost the fight and must allow

this man to die in bitter haze.
And I will tell the wakeful air
that little will it hear my praise
if such remorseless burning's there

will always be until I die
in thermogenic solitude
that crushes down beneath the sky
on whim's rayed from a sun so lewd.

Such thoughts are best to leave in bed
to fester there in sweating stress.
But now I rise with limbs of lead
to lead a life. And live with less

than I think that I'd like. Oh well.
But that's alright. So off to work.
But first a bit of coffee smell
as I proceed to skulk and lurk

through forums on the internet
that talk about what I don't do
because the time is lost. I let
myself believe there's nothing new

for me to try. So why not read
a little more of nothing here.
My nausea's constant lack of need
to eat will keep me thin, and fear

inside my head. Where it should be.
The face outside must stay a stone
of boredom. And the empathy
of others will be left alone.

Then out the door with gritted teeth.
Exhaust the lungs to keep them grey.
The bus is waiting down beneath
the sign - oh shit, he drove away.

That fuck. He's early every day.
Or maybe it's my phone that's slow.
The whole cell network must just stray
a tick or two, a breath or so.

Or seconds, maybe no one counts.
They should. How else can people try
to plan things in their time accounts
and get what's left before they die.

A walk, I guess, down sordid streets
my lateness grows with every pace.
A screech of tires, a horn that bleats
its discontent distorts the space

around me. And it makes me ache.
An irritant of vital cores.
The jaw must tense, the molars break,
with ringing thumps of slamming doors.

And I arrive, and here I am.
And where the hell is meaning found?
Not here, where no one gives a damn.
We bathe in soothing office sound.
