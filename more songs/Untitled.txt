River

Down by the river, where the current's slow,
thinking about what I've come to know.
Layin' on a rock that the sun has touched.
Holding a voice that's such
a place inside my head that I can

hear it like where I am from,
the air I breathed when I was young
will stay inside me till my song is sung.

Cause there's nothing like those early places.
Little footsteps on the trails
never lose the rhythm to get home.

Here comes a face that I always knew.
Flow Like a river, you're just passing through.
Wave with a smile and a sunny yawn.
Then comes the bend, and you're gone.
The place inside my head remains to

Tell me what I need to hear.
A song that flows so deep and clear.
A voice to stay behind and keep me near

to that galaxy of understanding.
Night has come, the sky's demanding
all of my attention - it's my home.

Wake to the song that the river sings,
sweeping along as the current brings
friends that we'll know for a little while.
Gone, we'll be left left with their smiles.

The place inside my head is full of
everyone who found a place,
collected in the strands that trace
my thoughts from one another. And a face

might burn a little brighter
if their song is keyed with mine. Where
I can look inside those eyes and find a home.

Down by the river where the water's new,
thinking about what I hope is true.
Here is a place that has learned to sing.
Where is the voice that rings right through me?
