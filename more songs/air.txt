Air

Hey Missus flower you've got sunlight in your eyes
and you go nicely with the cloudless skies
whose streaming blues wrap around me as I fly
far away from our green hill-side.

Life falls away as though it's thoughts that make it mine
and the air holds me for it's own designs
that I suspect, but can't be sure, will be alright.
And I try to keep you in my sight.

But nothings making sense I'm overwhelmed and there's too much
information, and it's such
a strange sensation creeping through the realm of conscious thought.
And I think you missed a spot
You're sleeping while I'm not
If I remain I'll rot
So flight is all I've got.

Hey Missus flower you're dance that never ends
as the wind blows, you can't help but bend
on with the beat out in a world full of feet
who have found where the rhythms meet.

Am I demanding, is it cold where I'm standing
will you wilt, as the summer wanes?
Truth is forever, and there's something rather clever
in the way that the moment reigns.

The air is welling up right underneath me, I'm ok
I love sky today.
You are rooted down to ways of living that I've found
would put me in the ground,
just bones under a mound.
I wouldn't make a sound,
as threads all came unwound.

I'm forgetting how to be a person as my vision shrinks away.
you're getting smaller as the buildings turn to toys for me to play
with and the rivers are just strings that tie the mountains to the plains.
There's nothing I can understand inside this state to make me stay.

Hey Missus flower you're the breath of morning air
that I found gasping from a little scare
as I landed just before the edge of madness
due to underexposure to blandness.

Hey Missus flower I can't tell if you're out there
but I hope you know that I'll always care.
Moonlight will guide me as the clouds hum beside me,
and I wish for you to be free.
