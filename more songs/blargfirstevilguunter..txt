Blacked out eyes in the mirror tell me that there's been combat of some sort - the sort where fists end up in my eyes. Right where you wanted them, just up nestled so they squish your seeing-grapes into your brain just enough that you see the lights and you have that instant of traumatic, nauseating pressure that makes you feel like you might just be dying for a half-instant. The coughing and black soot and moaning lungs tell me to call out: "You little arsonist fuck! What has your little cheese-eating ass got to say for itself? Where have you gotten your grubby banana-grabbers to?"
	That little monkey fucker bounds around, an addled maniac with his pipe bombs and his molotove cocktails and the rocket-propelled-grenades he cheats off of the generals of failed states with his monkey-poker cunning, and his fucking match-boxes all the fuck over the place, available to be grabbed and struck and nutured into some seriously destructive fuckery at a moments notice. It's those boxes of matches, they're the worst. Tucked into every goddamned nook and cranny. Unmaneagably innocuous and numerous, and only so many days in a row a man's coat gets set on fire while he's sleeping till he doesn't sleep so good anymore. I think maybe I'll slit the little bastards throat next time I get my fingers all twisted into the hair around his neck and squeezing - no screaming this time, just a warm, red flood of goodnight. And then the sleep... No more fire...
	He clangs a pot off festering kraft-dinner off of the stove - an act of sonic violence that shatters my morning-skull hangover and stings my eyes with a drench of hate-sweat as I lurch up and around and start yelling "What in sweet tits are you up to? Stop moving around so I can murder you to death!"
	
	

Clattering and clanking up toward a sun that forgot. Like fucked-up dogs, never learned how to bark properly, or men who only know what happiness maybe looks like, but not what it is.
