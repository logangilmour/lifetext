Desert
Memories that hold like the sand that's slowing, and
the wind's the one I told just where I was going.
I can hear it howl low - the dunes are always growing
with the little things they know.

Where did water go? Something I was feeling just a
million years ago. Now cold is sealing in the
voices, and the flow of moments is the stealing
of the little things I know.

Words in the sand blown away
the page is clean
Where did you stand? Nothing stays,
and Nothing's seen.

Dust is in my mouth. The monolith is rolling and I'll
keep on heading south. It wasn't worth consoling you,
the end decides the day. The wind is still controlling me,
and worlds drift away.

Days and days the same. Fragments crumble smaller till
I can't recall the name. Stumble, then I fall and tumble
down and rest my eyes. Up before I crawl beneath
the sand under the skies.

New must replace all the old.
The wind is strong.
Shifting my grip, losing hold
a memory's gone.

Wonder who I was. Eyes are gritty sore, and searching
for a place that doesn't seem like one before,
I hope that change will come to show that difference is a door
that going through will make me grow.

Faceless like a stone, worn away and plain,
and now it's sitting here alone, and although I strain
I cannot move it from its place, lodged inside my brain
so I will let it be erased.

On through the sand I must go,
to find the sea.
Fade in the wind, and I know
where I must be.
