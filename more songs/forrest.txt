Forest

Layin' in my bed with the words that pool settlin'
down in the sweat.
Slow breathing. Wait until the morning's met.

Getting in the shower with a burning bridge towering
down through my head
Still pounding. I keep hearing what you said.

I go out to the forrest where it's calm.
The dirt is getting worked into my palms again.
Leaves under my feet, I move along.
The wind has stirred the trees brush the wrongs away.

Sittin' by the fire with the thoughts that burn brighter than
souls in the sun.
Throw anger out, because what's done is done.

Starin' through shadows as they dance a new night into
life in the pines.
Dark faces melt into a turning mind.

Wrapped up in itself, the fire fades.
Tickling at my hands are little blades of grass.
Taking in a breath of cool air
to let it out, forget, so I can spare the time.

There's an animal out there
it's gotta be a big one
Like a sabre tooth tiger
mysterious enigma
with the jaws that are biting
like tyrannosaurus
and the claws that are catching
I hope they'll ignore us
I don't want surprises -
I'll just close my eyes.

How do I fall into these cycles so mixed up through
thoughts gone awry.
Mind system - strange attractors fling inside.

Settled in a pattern that'll strangle what should matter.
There's need for a shock.
New scenery - rumination will unlock.

I like to look at all the shapes that trees
and plants can make as they attempt to please
that inner repetition of the way
the universe is one with them to play their song.
