Icefields

I’ve been living on an icefield
Nestled up against the sky
I’m getting pretty settled in, and I’ve been talking to the 
wind for hours at night

The sun’s been my companion
we hang out every day
But I’ll be saying my goodbyes, cause he’s thinking that it’s
time to fly away

Run away, just run away
there’s no way off this frozen plain
The sky is just a precursor to violence

Cold today, it’s cold today
And so it stays, the wind will play
a song and dance of snow to the horizon

I’ve been laying on an ice field
gazing up inside the stars
there’s place inside my head, just like underneath a bed
that holds my heart

And all those little points of light
chatter with me as I smile
At the thought of all these friends, who have saved up just to spend
time for a while

Hide your face, just hide your face
the air is having a bad day
and it might try to bite you if it sees you

Don’t be late, no don’t be late
it’s time to take a little break
from worrying that no one will believe you

And there’s nothing that comes and there’s nothing that goes in this place
it’s a structureless void and the sky and the ice split the space
and it simplifies beauty and stretches the limits of mind
by reducing a life to a point on a plane at a time

I’ve been dreaming of an icefield
just a place that I could go
to be freed from all the thoughts, that I accidently bought
that move too slow

There’s a silence in the morning
that’ll settle as it grows
burning holes into the sky, till the world is dead and dry
and we go home

Here to stay, I’m here to stay
I’m frozen down to where I laid
my head to rest a while ‘till I found you

Now I play, oh now I play
a simple tune to feel the way
the sky is just the place the earth falls into
