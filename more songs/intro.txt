Hey tricksy young traveler, this book is for you!
To help you to find an adventure or two!

So drink up these words and then think up your thoughts.
The answer to "What's there to do now?" is Lots!

But people are many, and these books are few,
so give it away once you think you are through.

It wants to be free to go flitting through minds,
in hopes that new somethings will sprout where it finds

those neatest of people who twitch to the beat
of sideways discussions with toe-tapping feet

who think that the world could be changed here and there,
and know they just need to figure out where.

And you can make copies to help set the stage!
Just go to the site at the top of the page.

You're off to great places! The world is your book!
Your pages are waiting, so go take a look!
