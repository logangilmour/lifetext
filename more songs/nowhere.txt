Nowhere

When I woke this morning I could not hold on to meaning
I'm lost, and I think that I'm cold, and I'm leaning
my soul against the dark that was there, and it's falling
away so my fears cannot scare me, I'm calling
No name.

I can't remember what faces look like
Where do the eyes go, what chord should it strike
when they smile?

Is there air here, I cannot quite tell
Breathing gets hard when the reasons that well
up from dawn

turn inward in turbulent song
self justifying the current grows strong
pulls me down

into places I don't understand
Maybe if can just reach out my hand

It's strange, the way that choices can burn up the morning.
Destroyed, a bitter voice will unlearn an old warning.
Undone, a ball of guilt will unravel the sky.
I'm gone, there's other places to travel, but why?
No change.

Doomed preparations are thrown to the wind
Gods of the willing are focused on hindering
life.

There's a story I told to the sea.
It has no ending, and will not be free
from itself.

Run amok it's expanded through time.
The top is the bottom but people still climb
where are they?

I used to be able to play
Something from nothing, and pieces would stay.

I miss the little stars I could see when I knew where
I was, and things were simpler, easy, and true. But
they're not, so as the hope is collapsing to pain I'll
untie the tangled trails relapsing again.

New day.
