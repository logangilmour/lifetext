The plains await the mind's new rays
that spin across the past that stays
above the world that rose a ways
beyond the place where judgement weighs

its course to find a place to go
where someone shows and people know
the heart is thrown beneath the snow
to wait until the brains are slow

with strands of streaks of stars that keep
their waves into the settled deep
and force the fire of scars that seep
into the morbid scatterred sleep

that wakes the dead and hold the hands
of broken, shadowed, soul-drenched sands
whose elemental shaking stands
to fuel the failure that demands

that strangled spinning light and dark
across the night, and though the spark
has lit the coords that muscles mark
as energy is spent, we hark

to hear the sounds that make us fall
againts the love, the streaming call
of some who you wish was all
you'd waited for against the wall

that face that thinks, those eyes that drink
the whiskey when we've slept a wink
or none at all, and then we'll slink
across the wastes to find and link

a heart with hands, and hand with hearts
the slowing stops, and speeding starts
to hold the breath of other parts
and then it fucking ends.
