While walking along on the surface of mars
and watching a rocket crisscrossing the stars

and thinking of how it was full of the things
that everyone needs, like boosters and springs

she tripped over scraps of a ship that was downed
in wars over ice that we found in the ground.

She lay on her back while she looked at the sky,
and found the Earth shining and hoped she would fly

to see it some day. For she'd never been.
And traveling there seemed a way to begin

to learn strange new things with her eyes and her feet,
of oceans and mountains and people to meet.
