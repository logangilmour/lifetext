November 7th, 2012:
I realized that the player character in Blink should eat tiny people to turn the sky black and be capable of fighting the void.

November 8th, 2012:
I decided to make the Void grow fractally, the puzzle being to contain the fractal expansion by learning its rules.

November 9th, 2012:

I thought about seriously trying to make money with art videogames today.

November 11th, 2012
Busyness is the default state of the dying human.

I drank chamomile tea, which now apparently reacts with my increasingly volatile sleep-system to produce insomnia.

November 23rd, 2012
I'm coming to the realization that I want to work on video-games for kids, games that are what "Adventure Time" is to cartoons, or "The Wind in the Willows" to books.

November 24th, 2012
Sitting on the beach facing the ocean simplifies my mind in all four dimensions.

November 25th, 2012
