November 7th, 2012:
I realized that the player character in Blink should eat tiny people to turn the sky black and be capable of fighting the void.

November 8th, 2012:
I decided to make the Void grow fractally, the puzzle being to contain the fractal expansion by learning its rules.

November 9th, 2012:
I started generalizing my tree algorithm; it seems that going as far as coniferous and deciduous with one algorithm might be too general.

November 10th, 2012:
I thought about seriously trying to make money with art videogames today.

November 11th, 2012
Busyness is the default state of the dying human.

November 12th, 2012

When I'm done, I'll build a zepplin and roam the skies.

November 14th, 2012
Through CMPUT 250 I've rediscovered the distraction-free joy of the work-period between midnight and six A.M.

November 15th, 2012
Final all-night slog on our CMPUT 250 game beta.

November 22nd, 2012
I drank chamomile tea, which now apparently reacts with my increasingly volatile sleep-system to produce insomnia.

November 23rd, 2012
I'm coming to the realization that I want to work on video-games for kids, games that are what "Adventure Time" is to cartoons, or "The Wind in the Willows" to books.

November 24th, 2012
Sitting on the beach facing the ocean simplifies my mind in all four dimensions.

November 25th, 2012
I don't like analyzing art and writing about it - I'd much rather let ideas stay in their holistic form where they can be properly understood.

November 26th, 2012
Even a millisecond ago is the past.

November 27th, 2012
It's easier to go to sleep when I see the next day as being a mostly positive entity.

November 28th, 2012

I want to build a small game in which you observe your character engaging in far-off desert gun-battles in static scenes with muffled far-off gunshots and yells.

December 1st, 2012
Every human is a beautiful compounding of complexities, and to destroy such complexity is to brutally send the universe backward in time to the detriment of all.

December 2nd, 2012
Sometimes you have to lean back and ask yourself "What the fuck am I up to here exactly?"

December 3rd, 2012
I have about five months to get my body and mind ready for adventuring.

As I plan LiveBook, I'm getting a good feeling about building software again: specifically I am finding a new and healthier balance between art and automation.

December 11th, 2012
My abdominal pain appears to be correlated fairly strongly with stress, as I felt pretty good today with its absence.

January 10th, 2013
Animating tiny characters is fun and easy with ASEPRITE and my new tablet Yay!

January 12th, 2013
Built an Engineer Bag as I require a heavy thing to lift, and came to the conclusion that I should start a distributed republic.

January 13th, 2013
I worked on an independent study course in which I will hopefully investigate the idea of distributed organizations, and I finished Liza's awesome glider animations for The Crystals of Cloudia.

January 21st, 2013
Sorted out a component-oriented design for The Crystals of Cloudia that lets me easily move around and save data in the game and the level editor.

January 25th, 2013
Thinking about making The Crystals of Cloudia into some sort of dynamic dialog generation game based on a graph of relationships.

March 8th, 2013
Quiet night in stuffing my face with garbage and watching Raging Bull.

March 9th, 2013
Pretty much ready to try a first implementation of data-binder.

March 10th, 2013
Worked on data-binder.

March 11th, 2013

Played board-games for three hours in my last class of my undergraduate degree.

April 13th, 2013
I refactored databinder to be more internally consistent and simple.

April 14th, 2013
I got javascript-based view templating working in data-binder, and came to the realization that I should be able to replicate a data-binder instance simply by pointing another blank data-binder instance at it.

April 15th, 2013
I started reading 'Blackfoot Physics', which has been totally excellent.

April 16th, 2013
I've come to the conclusion that I like writing some of the time, and that I just need to cleanly sepparate the writing process from the editing process in order to like it all of the time.

... Start Grad School, hate Grad School, quit Grad School, get job. ...

April 13th, 2014
Oddly close to a year since I decided to start doing this again as part of my awareness value and my internal adventures project.

Broke my longest fast yet (~37 hours) and resolved to go on a MicroAdventure this friday as part of my new adventure-oriented life.

April 15th, 2014
Hungry and on edge while attempting to apply the sweet typography stuff I'm learning from "The Elements of Typographic Style".

April 16th, 2014
Getting closer to figuring out the magic spark of Adventure Time and other such things so that I can use it to help people better their lives.

April 17th, 2014
I suspect that rapid weight-loss is causing stones to form in my bile duct.

April  18th, 2014
Weighed in 2 pounds and a bit above my goal, and decide I've come far enough to start eating a little more and focusing on recomposition.

April 19th, 2014
Delicious Easter Dinner with my family, but didn't drink to much and went to bed at a decent time.

April 20th, 2014
Figured out the domain of the thing I want to write: AdventurePatterns.com!

April 21st, 2014
Made new friends at the rockwall, and climbed the highest-numbered rip-and-grip bouldering problem I ever have.

April 22nd, 2014
Figured out a dried fruit and nut daily meal.

April 23rd, 2014
Cycled to work in the rain, which prompted me to buy rain pants at lunch.

Sick, ate lots of oranges and watched adventure times.

April 25th, 2014
Got rid of many things.

April 26th, 2014

April 29th, 2014

Excited by a logo Mathias has been making for adventure patterns, sorted out simple comments on the blog, and had fun watching people make Drank in the office.

May 1st, 2014
Duncan's RAW thing was cool (maybe I will do it?), also lead the prow at virg and felt great.

May 2nd, 2014
Read Adventure Time Volume II by Ryan North, and loved it.

Serious money from grandpa, and found out Nathan has been in therapy and that it's working.

Discovered the low-reward diet and saw a nice choral thing with Mom, Nana, and Papa.

May 5th, 2014
Started writing an Eating Twice a Day post and met more people climbing.

May 6th, 2014
First day on the low-reward diet: felt suddenly hungry and deprived around 4pm, then ate potatoes, otherwise felt good.

May 7th, 2014
Good day of low-reward, felt great at points (band practice), though something in my diet messed up my voice and made it tight.

May 8th, 2014
Feeling much less hungry and a fair bit happier, and met more friends at the wall.

May 9th, 2014
Some strange moodiness in the afternoon, had considerable trouble not ruminating on an accidentally and unintentionally offensive thing I said, popcorn less exciting and more satisfying, a secret birthday!

May 10th, 2014
Felt fantastic in the morning, ran out of juice a bit in the afternoon, crushed that with plyo, then learned how a fourier transform works.

May 11th, 2014
Family lunch for mother's-day, bandpractice, handstands, RSS is alive.

May 12th, 2014
Disruptive crisis of purpose at work in which I considered the merits of ascetic living.

May 13th, 2014
Continued crisis into pretty debilitating depression, for which I suspect reducing coffee consumption coupled with low-reward lifestyle is responsible, then felt better jamming and smoking a couple cigarrettes.

May 14th, 2014
Felt way better than yesterday, got significant coding done, and furthered my understanding of dopamine as likely involved primarily in 'wanting' rather than 'liking'.

May 15th, 2014
Felt a bit deprived, but productive, and noticed a view of the cemetery hill I never have before.

May 16th, 2014
Found out that Mike tried to kill himself several times.

May 17th, 2014
Tired from drinking and staying up, but read a whole book on willpower and exercised anyway.

May 18th, 2014
Fun time with family tasting beers and eating ribs, though these foods are becoming more and more detached from pleasure.

May 19th, 2014
Designing a protocol for handling bad moods which seems to be pretty effective, also I figured out how to flip backward from sitting onto my hands!

May 20th, 2014
Wings with friends, cycled as hard as I could, found a great park and started "Man's Search for Meaning"!

May 21st, 2014
Got footnotes working with Adventure Patterns, figured out a simple search paradigm for BigPaper that solves all problems ever, and started reading 'The Phantom Tollbooth' again.

May 22nd, 2014
Implemented 'todo' colours on handles in BigPaper, and booked laser-eye surgery for May 29th!

May 23rd, 2014
Ate a little less today, and really, really felt the 'wanting' in the evening, also started considering building a distributed e-book search system.

May 24th, 2014
Good day, started eating chicken hearts, felt dead and soulless (probably because of diet) but then went climbing, got a couple difficult routes, and was brought almost to tears by the glint of sunlight off of a backhoe and a building in the distance in the cool spring evening air.

May 25th, 2014
Wrote lyrics to a song, started planning a kids serial where the information space and the real world are bridged, thought more about Ghost Library, and finished reading Man's Search for Meaning.

May 26th, 2014
Felt great all day, made plans for biking to devon, building a raft, and rafting back, and climbed the ten hardest routes I can climb.

May 27th, 2014
Another high-energy day (upregulation!?), saw Diane for the first time in a while, started attempting to record the album with Scott.

May 28th, 2014
Good energy in the morning, somewhat decreased in the afternoon, started reading 'A blueprint for your castle in the clouds', decided not to take on additional work, and excited for laser surgery tomorrow!

May 29th, 2014
Lasik surgery done, interesting procedure followed by improvement throughout the day, lots of eyedrops, sitting in the dark listening to 'The Power Broker'.

May 30th, 2014
A little drained, but can see, read 'Free Will' by Sam Harris, talked to kirby about his system.

May 31st, 2014
Ditched two chairs, destroyed a couch, and cleaned up the living room so that it's now a very nice little space, came up with 'Godcube' with Nate, and had lots of fun at the Mahsi farm event.

June 1st, 2014
Played Act III of Kentucky Route Zero and enjoyed it, and resolved to go to Guatemala and learn Spanish!

June 2nd, 2014
Extremely depressed in the afternoon and evening, definitely seems to be a correllation with drinking, also exercise is starting to be more and more addictive, and missing that because of lasik was also tough.

June 3rd, 2014
Slept in, good dev in the morning, introduced some coffee into my afternoon to combat depression (seems to have worked), went for a good ride with Scott and Gresiuk, great time dancing at marlaena's birthday, couldn't sleep.

June 4th, 2014
Very tired, generally decent mood, went to bed early after a good band practice.

June 5th, 2014
Good sleep, caffeine definitely helping the depression from dopamine withrawal, played through The Matter of the Great Red Dragon and AlphaLand, designed a small game played with cubes with Nate, and resolved to learn Unity and be a game designer once again!

June 6th, 2014
Rebuilt computer and installed Unity and Sketchup, started catching up on Extra Credits, excited to make games!

June 7th, 2014
Checked out the Strathcona farmer's market for the first time, and played around with Unity.

June 8th, 2014
Designed a cool shadow-noise shader!

June 9th, 2014
Watched Indie Game: The Movie (it was great) and came up with a little game idea based around my understanding of what makes people happy and successful.

June 10th, 2014
Designed a cool visual effect for our website at work, tried L-theanine in the morning (which, I think, was great), and decided that I'm going to focus purely on 3D, even for this ostensibly 2d game I'm designing, so I'm returning to Blender after many years.

June 11th, 2014
L-theanine gives me headaches maybe, played a show with Yes We Mystic and Cayley Thomas that went pretty well, good turnout, got pretty drunk with not very many beers, also had the excellent idea of making The Good Life shift from orthographic to 3D at some point - exciting!

June 12th, 2014
Hungover a tad, climbed anyway, played The Stanley Parable, which was excellent!

June 13th, 2014
Learned some math to build a cool transition effect for the company website, then made the box jump!

June 14th, 2014
Ideas in The Good Life really starting to crystalize, went to Matthias' thing and the nextfest smut party.

June 15th, 2014
Cooked up a week's worth of lentils, chicken hearts, and cabbage, and biked to father's day!

June 16th, 2014
Idea to make text as interlinked and interactive as possible, learned about platformer camera styles, got really cool transitions working for site, climbed route 25 and essentially all of GT.

June 17th, 2014
Depressed today (seems to be a correlation with drinking, specifically the second day after), played 'Dear Esther' and part of 'Gone Home', both of which are great.

June 18th, 2014
More depression, tired (think I'm getting sick, probably the drinking let it in), finished 'Gone Home' (Great!) and played some of Antichamber.

June 19th, 2014
Definitely a little sick, but seem to be fighting it off, decided to take part in Text Jam this weekend (Text-based game jam) and got the cool idea to build a twitch poetry stream of consiousness game!

June 20th, 2014
Game Jammin'

June 21st,2014
Game Jammin'

June 22nd, 2014
Finished and published something that's arguably a game, learned a lot about the possibility inherent in a weekend of time, and spent from 2pm onward decompressing.

June 23rd, 2014
Somewhat sick, listening to the new Dresden Files (which I love), and gearing up to maybe do a microgame jam this weekend.

June 24th, 2014
Employee review gave me a chance to ask about hours reduction, which went over well, and also lead to Scott bringing up the possibility of work time spent on games.

June 25th, 2014
Getting excited about the possibility of Sticks & Stones becoming, in part, a game company - Satch and Jordan are pretty stoked too, also found out about IndieQuilt, which I'm excited to take part in!

June 26th, 2014
Started reading 1Q84, decided not to do the RAW artist thing to focus on games, and decided to make a series of microgames themed on faith and spirituality.

June 27th, 2014
Slept in to heal, quiet day, really enjoying 1Q84, decided to take monday off to create a super-weekend, wrote a little thing on the blog.

June 28th, 2014
I am feeling uninspired by microgames, but also excited about making a rhyming Gunter and Felix game, also I finished the first book of 1Q84 (yay for good things) and I'm trying to pull my habits back together after being sick last week, nice time at Nat and Danika's warming, drank one beer and went to bed at a reasonable hour.

June 29th, 2014
Finished "The Universe Within", which was pretty good, had some depression followed by a good idea: information as infrastructure surveillance video game.

June 30th, 2014
Started planning July's Game: Building the Zeppelin!

July 1st, 2014
Resolved to fully commit myself to being creative for this month to see if I can reprogram myself to get most of my well-being from creating and restore a sense of hope in creation.

July 2nd, 2014
Finished 1Q84 book 2, so now full detached from any consumption, also had a good talk with kirby in which I realized that trying to directly change other people is often a violation of the 'circle of concern / circle of control' principle, also determined to attempt to meet, be interviewed by, and perhaps one day marry Cara Ellison.

July 3rd, 2014
Talked briefly with Scott about working on games a work, and he seemed receptive to the idea, also wrote some poems for objects in the game, and came up with the idea of gradually introducing information through a library system, climbed with Amy and Rechael and probably will again in the future!

July 4th, 2014
BigPaper is growing again, more and more excited about the company becoming more of a collective where we make cool stuff, also wrote some poetry for the game.

July 5th, 2014
Got some code working for the game, though it seemed like it took longer than it really should have.

July 6th, 2014
More code done, more ideas solidifying.

July 7th, 2014
Pretty depressed, decided to start writing poetry for each character based on their version of happiness and see what happens from there.

July 8th, 2014
Depressed still, wrote some decent poetry for one of the characters.

July 9th, 2014
Wrote more poetry, maybe slightly less depressed, felt weirdly sick for a couple hours, really enjoying new Louie!

July 10th, 2014
Depression seems almost gone, felt a bit nauseated toward the end of the day, climbed up GT and the back down to the V-wall in GT, poetry.

July 11th, 2014
Did work today, felt pretty good, mood decent, poeted, finished Louie, which was great!

July 12th, 2014
Good mood, got a fair bit done with the game, saw Laser Floyd.

July 13th, 2014
Tried ketamine in a bid to mitigate my recent depression, felt a bit weird and dissociated, realized the design I'd given up on in frustration the day before was actually pretty ok, wrote a bit of poetry.

July 14th, 2014
HOLY MOLY I HAVE NOT HAD THIS MUCH ENERGY IN SO LONG - I felt almost uncomfortable energized in the sudden complete absense of any depression - pretty sure the ketamine has something to do with in, but I also have been eating extremely healthy and upping my caffeine, then thought about the highway game, and saw Rob for the first time in a while and came up with 'Get To The Edge, AKA Dick Dimension'.

July 15th, 2014
Almost uncomfortably energetic for some of today, managed to get into the doctor, who figured I should try a mild SSRI for anxiety and depression, wrote more poetry, climbed all of GT (Minus getting off briefly for someone) without resting in any corners.

July 16th, 2014
Felt weird and bad (kinda like 2 years ago when I was really anxious) after drinking some coffee with raw cocoa (though it could have been something else), started taking medication, wrote poetry, watched some of the new legend of korra, good so far, and started reading a book on CBT: Feeling Good.

July 17th, 2014
All caught up on Legend of Korra, which is great, pretty sure I'm getting some nausea from the the medication, but apparently it should pass, started doing CBT exercises, which I firmly believe in, and realized my problem may be that I've become results-oriented instead of process oriented.

July 18th, 2014
Found out cami tried to kill herself on Wednesday.

July 19th, 2014
Did some work on Gunter, finished 'Feeling Good' (extremely useful) and read 'Zen in the Art of Writing' (good), got a mouse and play 'The Swapper' (fun!) and successfully refrained from eating garbage all day!

July 20th, 2014
Wrote poetry, finished 'The Swapper', and watched 'The Thing', which was great!

July 21st, 2014
Decided to start working on the highway game (as a sharecart game!), and watched Road to Perdition, which was pretty good.

July 22nd, 2014
Fun climb with rachael, depression levels seem to be lowering.

July 23rd, 2014
Started working on highway game, which actually felt really good, and moved talked to Scott about making games at work a bit, which seemed to be received well.

July 24th, 2014
Designed a really cool sky for the highway game that works with mouse-look, good work on cleaning up our work website, learned rsync and some shell scripting for a deployment script.

July 25th, 2014
Went to the doctor and I am nice and healthy other than slightly low blood sugar, battled Unity until it rendered me some nice billboard sprites!

July 26th, 2014
Tons of awesome progress on the highway game - folliage, modelled most of a car, generating the scene, modelled barriers - spent almost the whole day on it and felt great!

July 27th, 2014
More progress: Car improved, movement, shading backfaces enabled, also discussed the game a bit with the guys.

July 28th, 2014
Getting a sense of the gameplay for the car game, watched Grave of The Fireflies, which was good but sad, started working on Everything Burns at work, and got some pretty decent looking fire going.

July 29th, 2014
Fire is looking great, and also sorted out how to dissolve meshes with a simple but awesome effect, felt generally great!

July 30th, 2014
Felt a little off, but got some work done, and had a nice band practice.

July 31st, 2014
Bit of work on everything burns, realized that I should look around a little more.

August 1st, 2014
Designed a cool map at work!

August 2nd, 2014
Got particle system working for trees in the highway game, and watched 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', which was great!

August 3rd, 2014
Nice evening with my parents, started reading 'The Girl who Played with Fire'.

August 4th, 2014
Read, packed.

August 5th, 2014
Read, went to Mickey's goodbye party.

August 20th, 2014
Back from vacation at Shambala and Grand Forks!

August 21st, 2014
Feeling a little trapped and depressed, but then quite good after climbing.

August 22nd, 2014
Depressed, but then had some beers and started on Everything Burns and felt pretty good.

August 23rd, 2014
Everything Burns

August 24th, 2014
Everything Burns

Aupust 25th, 2014
Worked on Everything Burns at work, and got a playable thing submitted to Ludum Dare!

August 26th, 2014
Dealt with shader bugs, saw spiderman outside, which I don't think is an experience I would repeat.

August 27th, 2014
Had a nice band practice after which I felt really good!

August 28th, 2014
I watched Sunshine, which was great. I also felt pretty good at work. Additionally, I decided to start writing more than one sentence if I feel like it, rather than writing ridiculous and ungrammatical one-liners when lots of cool stuff happened.

August 29th, 2014
Fun party for jesse's birthday. I felt amazing toward the end of the day, probably in part due to the fact that Satch, Bloemen and I bought an occulus rift dev kit 2!

August 30th, 2014
Woke up pretty hungover, then packed up and began the least organized climbing trip I've ever been on. Camped at an awesome secret spot on crown land just outside the park gates.

August 31st, 2014
Great day of climbing! I felt more confident than ever before leading outside. Then we pushed a bunch of dead trees off of the top of the cliff by the campsite, and made a huge and awesome fire from the resulting firelog size fragments! I got pretty drunk.

September 1st, 2014
Another good day of climbing. I sucessfully struggled my way up a 5.12b for the first time at Rock Gardens, which I'd like to revisit some day.

September 2nd, 2014
Riffed on the idea of an animated tv show of the office, and discussed the possible potential of Everything Burns as a ground-breaking occulus game with Satch and Bloemen.

September 3rd, 2014
Officially a half-time employee!

September 4th, 2014
Used new freedom to pack up for a trip to the mountains, then played around with instruments with Duncan, Casey, and Natasha.

September 5th, 2014
Drove up to the Skyline trail and started hiking with Dad, Mark, and Jesse!

September 6th, 2014
Hiked through Little Shove and Big Shovel passes.

September 7th, 2014
Hiked up through the Notch, then along an awesome ridgeline, then all the way out, to avoid possible bad weather.

September 8th, 2014
Nice day chilling at home recharging from the hike.

September 9th, 2014
Had fun writing and recording some guitar riffs at work. Climbed with Casey, and met D'Arcy and Brian.

September 10th, 2014
Felt motivated, got most of mobile site working. Played with the oculus all day, and decided that I agree with satch that everything burns is probably not the best game to make, and that we should pander a bit.

September 11th, 2014
Had my wisdom teeth removed, and then spent the day on the acreage with mom. Watched Her, which I really enjoyed.

September 12th, 2014
I had a good talk with Dad about antidepressants and such. I felt pretty decent, and am healing well. I figured out a nice system for rendering procedural objects in 3d, and agreed to move in with Aaron, Nice, Kyle, Dagny, Sohaila, and Khojesta!

September 13th, 2014
Pain came back a fair bit, but managed to get flat-shaded polys working. Watched '12 years a slave', which was excellent.

September 14th, 2014
Felt a bit better, and had a nice dinner with the family.

September 15th, 2014
Watched Mad Men, felt crappy.

September 16th, 2014
Watched Mad Men, felt crappy.

September 17th, 2014
Bought a sweet computer for oculus development!

September 18th, 2014
Had a beer with the guys and talked about directions for the cave game.

September 19th, 2014
Went to a party at Steph's, had a nice time. Cats didn't seem to bug me much with the antihistamines.

September 20th, 2014
Cleaned up the house and moved some stuff, and Watched Toy Story 3, which was pretty good. Also had some exciting thoughts about directions for the Cave Game.

September 21st, 2014
Biked all over the place to update graphics card to the newest version while listening to 'The Cuckoo's Calling', which I'm quite enjoying. Thought about voxel-based global illumination hacks.

September 22nd, 2014
Stayed up late messing around with the Unreal Engine in an attempt to get a basis for procedural meshes working.

September 23rd, 2014
Learned about global illumination, had a good climb, and decided to start being a night person again.

September 24th, 2014
Sorted out a couple of songs to write lyrics to, and played around with the highway game.
