Voices stray across the days 
and now they've passed beneath the waves.
Although the night is dark, I'll stay
to see the moon and clouds who say

they know a man who knows a thing
about the ways the sky can bring
the depths of men to fall and cling
to scattered parts of plans that fling

themselves across the minds whose hands
are digging down beneath the sands
of deserts where the smallish stands
of trees whose bird now understands

that life has made the best mistake
and given him a place to wake
his dreams that find themselves at stake
because there's a whole world to make.

I called that man whose thing was known
about the sands whose trees were shown
to one lone bird who'd flipped and flown
across the space of place alone.

A telegram was sent in song
through wires who could sing along
with resonance so sweet and strong
to ask the bird to come belong.

And so he did, and soon did say
that I'd do well to fly away.
"The sky is where you ought to stay,"
He crowed while looking at the way

that all the thoughts I had in mind
were sailing high as though to find
the thermals someone left behind
while waiting as the stars aligned.

I heard the words and closed my eyes
to see the winds of plans whose size
could only fly if I would rise
to build a zeppelin, roam the skies.
