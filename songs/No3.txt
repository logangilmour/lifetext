When we began again we found
it's easier next time around.
We knew the shapes and lengths and sound
of timbers creaking as they found

their place within the form that grew
to fill the space we built it through.
And so our thoughts began anew
of where to find those people who

are worth the wait and make you sing
and dance along a little string
of thoughts reminding you to bring
your heart along with everything

that people need to stay alive
because without it you'll arrive
to find that though you did survive
those misplaced dreams will seldom thrive.

The sun awoke and so did we
to rise and blink and look and see.
Our work all done, our spirits free,
we watched the fading shadows flee.

We boarded in the morning mist
and Felix read me out the list
of all the things that must exist
for minds and bellies to persist

across the void where dragons fly:
"A crate of beans, a glass to spy,
some ropes who know which knots to tie,
a map of stars to show us why,

we shouldn't wait until they change."
They seldom do. And so we'll range
across the mountains dark and strange
and through the night while we arrange

the many things we'll need to take
as we go forth to find and make
the friends whose minds will whirl and ache
as ways of being come awake.
