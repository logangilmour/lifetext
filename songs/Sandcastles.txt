Sandcastles

Hold my hand.
The sand we feel be
tween our toes is
what we chose. The

Sun is warm.
My skin absorbs the 
stirring of the 
storm that flies in

side the wind,
where cold begins. It's 
time we need, it's 
air we breath, it's

Life. We only know
our thoughts by how
they feel when they're
gone.
