They put me in a box
but I'm the one who locks
myself in to stay alone
so I'm whitened like a bone

and the curtains must be drawn
or my life it will be gone
when they come take my stuff
I just hope that it's enough

That I didn't talk to you
we knew it wouldn't do.
you just standing on the train
me just waiting in my brain

=== Chorus ===
Cause we're strangers
who live in cities
that have dangers
and it's not pretty
so we're going home
===================

My life's a grid of cars
with horn's that tend to jar me
when I'm walking to the door
that holds the grocery store

there's something that I need
I'll know it when I see it
there's something that'll feed
the itch that's like a magnet

=== Chorus ===
Cause we're strangers
who live in cities
that have dangers
and it's not pretty
so we're going home
===================

I'm riding on the train
the people want to stab me
I can tell by how they strain
to smile like they're friendly

So I'll fidget with my hands
if I'm furtive they will smell it
keep my eyes behind my back
and my worries like a bullet

You're so pretty I'm afraid
there's nothing I will say
I'll bow my head instead
and sleep until the station

=== Chorus ===
Cause we're strangers
who live in cities
that have dangers
and it's not pretty
so we're going home
===================
