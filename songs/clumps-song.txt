I was born the day
you mowed after the rain
You freed me from the bag
but didn't raise your blades

or sharpen them the way you should.
I lumped into a clump that could
be helping keep your lawn alive
So help me help you fertilize.

Just take a second pass
across some drier grass
So I can fade away.
becoming grass again...
