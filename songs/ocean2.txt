I'm wandering through the backstreets of my mind
and trying to prove that everything's alright.
The static's pouring in to take my sight
and send my tension spinning through the night.

Hold you close I'm wondering where are your eyes.
I feel the waves, their crumbling sighs.
I'll wear these caves as my disguise.

Look through time the space inbetween us is curved.
We orbit closer, patterns preserved.
A woven spiral, still unnerved, observed.

The ocean is the hole where I will fall.
Simplified, there's nothing there at all.
I thought there might be ansers; I was wrong.
It's questions that I needed all along.

Turbulent, we're flowing, ripples recede,
Churning through the rocks where we bleed
our simple comforts into need.

Monument, a stone stands, tears us in two.
When seas are calm, then everything's true,
but currents form and pull us through the blue.

Occilate my strength away,
a Circle formed from neural waves,
that break on shores where no one strays,
a peaceful place with peaceful days.

I know that it is fine to breath,
'cause we are all the tides that seath
with life the singing moon will play
until we are so far away...

I'm floating out to sea, and where are you?
The air's a little cold, it's cutting through.
I'll settle in my bones and fall asleep,
and feel your presence pulsing through the deep.
