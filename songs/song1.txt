A Brisk Walk

1.	I'm going for a walk now that the sun is soon to settle in
behind that little mountain that has found itself a place inside my 
mind. Now I'm standing while my feet collect their thoughts, and then I'll go to other places where the air is just as sweet as here.

2.	I know that there's a little hollow in that tree
where people put the things they don't want anyone to see.
Though I could hope that nothing's there but fallen leaves,
the way the wind is changing makes it harder to believe.

1.	A bird breaks into song because he's happy that there's songs for him to sing, he pushes out the little troubles that I cannot help but bring.
There's only sadness in the absense of a thing to make you glad,
So I'll keep walking looking 'round at all the growing things. 

2.	It's too bad that the day must end, but it's alright -
the rythm of my dreaming will echo through the night.
A person that I used to know has come and gone,
I'd thought of calling out, but now instead I'm moving on.

1.	The shadows are quite long, as though they're pondering the structure of the soul, and how it's woven with the people and the places that we know.
They lay there waiting for the day on which they'll finally see the sun,
when all the walls have been torn down and they can fly away.

2.	I run across a meadow 'cause it's beautiful
the sun is sinking down and soon the moon sigh and pull
a gentle breath of stars across the autumn sky
I'd better get on home, because the light's begun to die.
