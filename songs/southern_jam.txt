One more nickel and one more dime
break my back just to be on time
in one more day I'm gonna lose my mind
gotta pick my ass up and get in line

well my bod's wearing out so the money comes in
and I gotta ask myself how I got spread so thin
cuz when the sun gose down I still got bills to pay 
either way, and it's a doggamn shame.

working at a job that keeps making me sick
gotta tough it out so the rich get rich
I've got miles to go before I turn in
can't take much more of the clatter and din

well my body's wearing out so the money comes in
and I gotta ask myself how I got spread so thin
cus at the end of the day no one gives a damn
bout the working man, and it's a goddamn shame

Oh, I'm breaking down
Cus at the end of the day no one give a domn
about the working man, and it's a goddamn shame
one more nickel and one more dime,
ino one more day I'm gonna lose my mind.
