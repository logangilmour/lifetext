I wait, and though the sky is grey
The day is young, I feel the way
the sun will shine another day
and mind of mine will turn and say

The sun is bright and full of time
it talks and waits through muck and grime
for love to come, a thought, a crime
of passion's ringing heart sublime.

He walks a walk that talks to stalk
across a plane of broken squalks
of birds that circle high and strange
to wait and see a mind deranged

be driven from the glaring heat
into the arms of new deceit
which trembling in the birth of day
has thrown down arms and turned to play

a song across that shattered star
that fell, and broke, and scattered far
to seed the stream of thought that threw
a world into an age so new.
