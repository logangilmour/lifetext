Where Do I Go?

=== Intro Verse ===
Maybe feeling lonely sometimes,
Go wander through the people standing with their smiles.
Wish for someone here to help you 
flip all the switches, toggle buttons and turn the dials

=== Intro Chorus ===
that set up all the ways you are
don't worry cause you're doing just fine so far
Hold on tight till you see
the whole of things, then lay it to rest, let it be.

=== Special Verse === 
[Each line a different person, last word overlaps on a major third]

Please oh please just don't be angry - now.
Holding back and waiting to see - how
When the world is falling into - guilt
tired, with eyes like broken windows built

=== Regular Verse ===

built before the world was broken you
don't remember much and maybe that's ok.
Taste the way the world is growing, breath
hold it in and let your worries ebb away

=== Chorus ===
and tell me all the ways you are
don't worry cause you're doing fine so far
Hard things help you to see
the whole of things, so lay it to rest, let it be.

=== Verse ===
Bombed out buildings line the streets the
war is over but there's not much left to love
Don't worry we'll buy it back son.
Guilt will smoulder, and the rain falls from above.

=== Bridge === [Harmonies Here, Repeat Twice]
Waiting, watching, holding on and
wishing, worried, where's it gone the
doubting's, fading, light has shone, it's
burning, bleeding in the dawn.

=== Chorus === [Should there be one here?]
Remember all the ways you are
don't worry cause you're doing fine so far
Some people will never see
the whole of things, so lay it to rest, let it be.

=== Ending Verse ===
You can't build a city in a day. 
So do things you can, you'll be ok.
Grow a few grey hairs and leave them there.
Cause we won't all get the chance, so learn to play

A song that makes you smile. It's been while.
Love the people that you're with, don't be afraid.
Most will stick around to hear the sound
of the changes that the flow of years has made

Some things make you sad. It's just the way
that the world turns the night into the day.
