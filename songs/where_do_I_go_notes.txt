Intro:



Present. Atmospheric. Not home wherever I was.

always loney, especially around peple
this is your home, no this is your home
fighting
It's ok to make mistakes, 
no trust
governments are parents
animosity between families

tlaking to dad, promising if you move here, we'll see games, dirbike, shameless. Did those things. Guilt. leaving mom. Jessica didn't come, stayed in bc. When I was sick she'd make me soup (sister) argued though. Too close. Playing denist with sister, hands in mouth.

Phone mom, dad' makes you feel bad for being upset for missing. Pulled apart. Didn't want anywone to be angry. Mom didn't make you feel bad.

Three years old. Don't remember the early years. Ravine, spraying glass seeds. 

A divorce changes everything, shifts the world. Family with a rift. Bombed out buildings.

Realization that some people you can't make happy. You only have yourself. It's not your job. Some people are just assholes.

Mom's always been there. Haven't talked to dad, got drunk instead of wedding. called at two in the morning. Didn't remember, birthday next day.Haven't talked since. Sister doesn't talk either. Dad can only talk about house, picture of niece. Ok with that decision.

anxious after talking, insecurities shine through. A lot of demons. Am I like him?

Manic depressive or bipolar.

Dad: Millwright/electrician. 

Mom: Legal assistant, office, city of leduc now. Moved from BC
new boyfriend who's a cop though. Cop upset about still on plenty of fish. lots of baggage. Trying to give me stuff. Brother in law birthday, cop buys breakfast. Taking mom to mexico. Buying people. Like dad, I did this for you, do it for me. Methodical. Mom seeks out emotionally abusive.

Cathleen stepmom, married for 20 years. Divorced when I moved out. Teen angst: Scapegoat. Cathleen's dad a mean alcoholic, warning signs from dad should have done something, maybe she thought she could save him?

Mom with a guy common law for a long time, never officially remarried.

11 when moved to dad's. Grade 6. Before: Half summmer ontario, every other christmas, same once moved. Some kids in neighborhood, not friends once moved out.

I Don't want to owe anyone anything.
Just let me live. Don't manipulate.

want to talk to myself when I just moved to dad's really any time

might have hated mom if she hadn't let me go, needed to know my dad.

walking out of a burning house.

Grew out of being a kid and everything is awesom, become young adult, suffered on my own, couldn't talk to dad. 

Incident: Broke up, doomed, I was crazy, wished I could have talked to somebody about it. Thought I loved here. Hated myself. In trouble. Mentioned, dad shaving, cathleen there, broke up with laura, off and on once or twice, "Again?" while shaving. Dismissive. Need somone that wouldn't judge you. I felt guilty about how shitty I felt, there's worse things in the world. 

Your pain is real, but it will be ok. It fades. Not brave enough to let myself out. 

I'm Like Dad: Quick to critisize, temper, (not since shauna), defensive if insulted, person probably didn't mean anything. Dad reacts weirdly to stuff too. Good things to, I can work hard, 
at work I hate assuming I'm right, I'll doubt what others are doing, problem solving, he taught me how to do that. I just don't want to be an asshole. 

Unhappy old people smoking ciggarettes.

Self-destruction.

look froward to growing old, becoming happier, choosing the people you have in your life.

Living my own life for the last ten years, moved here at 21, since I stopped talking to my dad, learning what it is to be me, that it's ok to be me
You can let other people define you. Get rid of the reinforment of what other people think you are, you're forced to find yourself.

Does my dad know me better than I know myself? Self doubt battle.

Noticing some grey hairs.

Future: I believe I am always growing. Good or bad, it's always different, there's something to learn. Life's full of uncharted territory.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes: everybody makes them.



I would go back and listen. Having someone I could tell stuff and they wouldn't get mad or be sarcastic. 

I feel like I tell a lot of people, like I'm trying to get sympathy, but it's just me.

Circles of doubt, other stuff, no conclusions, rumination, stirs everything up. Hurricane.

It's a weird feeling to let go.
