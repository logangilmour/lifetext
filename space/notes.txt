The God(s) of Space

Hotline-miami-esque controls, with caveat that rotation to face cursor happens according to feedback controls so the rotation is more realistic.

Very simple black-and-while line graphics.

Maybe build a level-editor FIRST and then derive the game from that.

Explore old space-stations and asteroid fields.

What is the goal? Mindless, wandering understanding?

The massiveness of space destroying the self and belief - annihilation of god.

Fucking around with old space-stations that will defend themselves with turrets and drones and whatever.

Pseudo-realistic sound, in that you don't hear anything that doesn't contact your ship. Whoosh of a missile, then clatter of debris.

Lonelyness

Acoustic guitar music because fuck you.

Getting from place to place. Maybe just a map? Part of the point of not just missiling the bases is to find out where the other bases are first by docking. 

These things are basically pests left over from something unknown - maybe an old alien race, maybe an old earth colony, whatever.

Information communicated about locations and weaknesses of other stations through story.

Maybe eventually stations know more and more about you and start sending out probes to kill you and stuff.

Colours indicate hostility, maybe damage, whatever.

Things have state such as: player-controlled, hostile, vital, etcetera. Vital things being destroyed ends the game. Hostile things attack you and won't attack other hostiles.

About lonelyness and human interaction mitigated by machines.

You have the option to not destroy the stations, but it's easy to do so once you've found the locations of the others.

In fact, you should be able to progress through the game in many different ways.
