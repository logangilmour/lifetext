Simplify:
"Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler." 
Constantly prune and care for my life without going so far as to harm it. Carefully weed out unproductive distractions and cultivate a small but vibrant garden of relationships, skills, habits, knowledge's, and goals into more than the sum of its parts.

Remember:
When things seems bleak, remember that there is beauty in the world. Remember that there are people whom I care about and who care about me. Remember that I've been joyful. Return to thoughts I know I have been excited about and rekindle the fire. Connect with people I love.

Be Present:
Hold onto the moment. Savour time with family and friends. Reign in thoughts of the future so that I don't miss the present. Taste food. Meditate on the world around me. Breath deeply.

Create:
Find flow. Don't question and analyze so much that I stop creating, but don't create blindly. Seek out new experiences and then draw upon them. Experiment. Push boundaries. Make something exist.

Be Flexible:
Truly consider a variety of paths when making a choice. Listen deeply to others and myself. Be willing to abandon entrenched ideas. Be like water.

Be Free:
Strive for a healthy degree of autonomy, and help others do the same. Do what I can to help free information. Be transparent with my thoughts and feelings. Overcome uncertainty, and go out into the world and live a life I believe in. Laugh.

Be Spiritual:
Work toward an understanding of why we are here, and try to align my life and the world with what I believe that to be. Ponder beauty, meaning, and life both logically and emotionally. Record findings.
