Psychological videogame (Codename "House-call")

You, commissioned by others, possibly criminals, governments, etcetera, creep into people's homes and do fucking psychiatry on them. Could be called mindology or something.

include made up quotes by made-up psychologists

Draws from: McPixel, A dangerous method, Naked lunch, Dumbland

You go around diagnosing and treating people's made-up psychological disorders with invented remedies. It will be a logic puzzle game. You will learn the best methods of treatment and how they affect patients. You should have the feel of the early psychologists and doctors, grave robbing baby stealing type stuff. You are likely armed, and may have to ocaisonally run for it. Maybe terrible first-person shooter simulation here and there?

Consider freuds crazy shit where everything is linked to sex.
