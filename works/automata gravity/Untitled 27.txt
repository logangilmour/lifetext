It took me a moment to sort out where everyone was. The space in front of the hall where everyone set up wasn't very visible. Approaching, I wasn't really sure where I should be. I was pretty sure I only there to observe, and I wasn't sure where to stand as to be out of the way.
	As the roundance began to form, I thought about where it would be best to experience it from. It occurred to me that most people might be near or join in, so I decided to head up to the top of the physics building to observe from above. I found a good vantage from inside a stairwell, which was also warm. I hadn't dressed for the weather.
	From inside, the round-dance seemed quiet and somewhat orderly. I could barely hear the drums. An oddly-shaped circle formed inside the pathways of the Quad, then a small group people moved to the center, then the circle rotated. Ocaisonally breaks and overlaps would emerge in the motion, but these would heal organically. There was occaisonal yelling that was audible through the glass, but that was it. Then movement stopped, and after some time the circle dispersed. I don't know the significance of the round-dance, though I think I would reconize the proceedings as part of First Nations culture.
	Maybe viewing the dance from outside would have had more impact; I don't know. If so, timing it to take place while classes changed would have made a bigger impact. People inside buildings looking out might be curious, but I'm not sure how strong an impression the flash mob would make on them. There wasn't much in the way of sineage, so an observer would need some context to even understand what was going on. The round dance seems itself to be communal introspection, with everyone literally facing inward. The flash mob seemed to be about internaly solidifying the movement rather than sending a message or raising awareness.
